## The fundamentals
### Looking to nature for inspiration
Scientist have long looked to nature for inspiration; the field of biomimicry is devoted to developing techniques to emulate nature’s strategies. For example geese, and other migratory birds, fly in a ‘V’ formation when travelling long distances. Research shows that birds participating in such formations will have significant increases to their range while exhibiting lower heart rates during flight compared to flying alone.

### The aerodynamics
The aerodynamic fundamentals behind formation flight for aircraft are fairly well understood. As an aircraft flies, the pressure differentials created over the wings’ surface, generates lift. The wake (often called vortices) left behind the lifting-wing induces downwash inboard, between the aircraft wingtips, and a corresponding upwash outboard. In theory this means that if an aircraft flies through this region of upwash can get some 'free lift' (essentially operating at a lower angle of attack, reducing induced drag) and in turn **save fuel**.

### Ok so how much can we actually save?
While estimates regarding the exact levels of drag reduction are mixed, they all remain extremely promising. Some flight tests have recorded levels of induced-drag being reduced by as much as 40-60% for the trail aircraft in a formation of two, equating to roughly a 20-30% reduction in total drag. Alongside this, tests have also directly measured fuel-flow reductions, for an aircraft flying in the upwash of another aircraft, at levels of anywhere **between 4-18%**. Importantly for commercial formation flight, these kinds of savings can been observed **flying as much as 10-40 wingspans behind the leading aircraft**.


### Airbus Fello'fly 
> "The Airbus fello’fly demonstrator project is putting the principles of wake-energy retrieval to the test as a way to reduce CO2 emissions—by between 3 and 4 million tons per year on widebody operations. But flying two large passenger aircraft close together poses new operational challenges for the aviation ecosystem at large, requiring new procedures to be identified."


This video by Airbus excellently describes how these concepts could be utilised in order to actually realise some of these fuel savings.

> "Initial flight tests have already begun. The fello’fly team and their flight test colleagues are testing pilot assistance technology—designed to ensure safety standards are optimal when flying two aircraft close together—in a programme that will lead the way to flight demonstrations in an oceanic airspace in 2021, involving airlines and ANSPs and a controlled Entry-Into-Service by 2025."
