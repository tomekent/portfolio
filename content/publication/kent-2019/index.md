abstract: "This paper looks to use both centralised and decentralised implementations of Evolutionary Algorithms to solve a dynamic variant of the Multi-Agent Travelling Salesman Problem. The problem is allocating an active set of tasks to a set of agents whilst simultaneously planning the route for each agent. The allocation and routing are closely coupled parts of the same problem, this paper attempts to align the real world implementation demands of a decentralised solution by using multiple populations with well defined interactions to exploit the problem structure."
