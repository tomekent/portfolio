abstract: "This paper explores the impact ground delay can have on designing and executing rendezvous operations such as formation flight. For a given formation pairing the route is fixed, speed policies are then generated to compensate for uncertainty in take-off times. Value Iteration is used to solve both the deterministic and stochastic Dynamic Programming problem for an entire state-space. The final optimal policies determine what course of action aircraft should take for any realization of delay. Finally a comparative case study shows that even with delay, formation flights can reach expected savings of 6.1% against flying solo"
