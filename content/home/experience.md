  This project employed a number of my research interests, areas of control, optimisation, simulation and mathematical modelling within a robotics setting. I was tasked with the design, implementation and testing of a number of motion planning and decision making algorithms. With the algorithms being
capable of driving a car autonomously for a set real-world trials involving members of the public. Some of the most useful insight gained from this was not only how big the jump can be from theory and simulation to real-world implementation but also physical integration between hardware and bespoke software from
a number of project partners with differing requirements.
